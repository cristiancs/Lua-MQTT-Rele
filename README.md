LUA MQTT Rele
===================


The idea behind this project is to make ESP8266 a IoT Rele that can control the lights with Siri and Homekit, and Also use my project HomePI with it

----------


How to use It
-------------
Open config.lua and edit the file with your config data.

Upload all the files to your ESP8266, i used ESPlorer for it.

You will need a MQTT server for this, im using mosca with the default example.

For testing you can use MQTT Lens a extension for chrome.

In the file relay.lua you can find all the channels where the ESP8266 connects and edit if as your convenience.
